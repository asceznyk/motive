## What do we want? - Philosophically

Essentially we want to solve long-term and short-term problems and have a lot of fun!

### Short-term:
1. CTFs - [picoCTF](https://play.picoctf.org/practice){:target="\_blank"}, [HackTheBox](https://hackthebox.com/), etc.
2. Competitive Progamming - [codeforces](https://codeforces.com), [leetcode](https://leetcode.com), etc.
3. Small Projects - 2D games, text editors, compilers, toy projects

### Long-term (choose one):
1. ML Library - like [this one](https://github.com/geohot/tinygrad)
2. OS from scratch
3. 3D Game - FPS or something like that
4. Linux shell - alternate to [nu](https://github.com/nushell/nushell) or [bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) 
5. Self-driving system - like [comma.ai](https://comma.ai)

What our day should look like:
```
start --> short-term --> job --> long-term --> end
```

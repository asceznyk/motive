## What do we want? - Philosophically

Essentially we want to solve long-term and short-term problems and have a lot of fun!

Short-term:
1. CTFs - picoCTF, HackTheBox, etc.
2. Competitive Progamming - codeforces, leetcode, etc.
3. Small Projects - 2D games, text editors, compilers, toy projects

Long-term (choose one):
1. ML Library
2. OS from scratch
3. 3D Game - FPS or something like that
4. Linux shell - alternate to `nu` or `bash`
5. Self-driving system 

What our day should look like:
```
start --> short-term --> job --> long-term --> end
```
